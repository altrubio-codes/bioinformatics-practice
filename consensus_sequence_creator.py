"""
This script creates a consensus sequence from three DNA strands
by determining the most common nucleotideat each position.
The consensus sequence is built by comparing the nucleotides
at each position across the three strands and selecting the one that appears most frequently.
The resulting consensus sequence is printed at the end.
