"""
This script cleans a messy DNA sequence by removing spaces
and converting all letters to uppercase.
It then calculates and prints the total length of the cleaned DNA sequence.
The script first defines a raw DNA sequence that contains spaces and mixed case letters.
It uses the `replace` method to remove all spaces and the `upper` method to convert all letters to uppercase.
Finally, it calculates the length of the cleaned DNA sequence and prints it.
